for my project 1 I will be create a game where you have to dodge object falling from above and the goal of the game is to survive as long as you can. The duration you need to survive is 1 miniute long and you can not get hit by any objects or you will fail. You can also get to choose the difficulty levels.

or

my back up game plan is the a game where you get stuck in a maze and have to find a away out.
